            Identifying the Gap In an ever-evolving world&lsquo; school photography
            had remained stagnant for over two decades. We saw a gap in the
            market&lsquo; a disconnection between what parents deserved and what they
            were receiving.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-normal sm:text-xl sm:leading-8">
            Despite paying a premium for their children&apos;s school photos&lsquo; parents
            were often left with lackluster resultsâ€”images that failed to
            capture the true essence of their child&apos;s journey through education.
